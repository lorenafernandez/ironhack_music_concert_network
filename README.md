# Music Concert Network

##Iteration 1

Create the application site.
We need to ble able to add a new concert.
Each concert should have a page where you can see its details.

At least you should store the band, the venue, the city, the date, a price and a description.
Validate that all concerts follow that format.
Create an appropiate header and footer for all the pages of the application.

##Iteration 2

In the front page we will be able to see what is happening today.
In a sidebar should appear a list called "later this month" with links to all the concerts later this month.

##Iteration 3

Each concert can be commented so the visitors can say someghing about the concert.
Style the comments in boxes.

##Iteration 4

Add a page where the user can say how much is he willing to spend...
...and it should appear a list of future concerts with a price lower than the indicated price.
